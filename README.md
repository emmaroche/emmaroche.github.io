### GitHub Repo for Careers-Guidance-App-FYP: [Careers Guidance iOS App](https://github.com/emmaroche/Careers-Guidance-App-FYP.git)

The Careers Guidance App is an iOS mobile application that I am developing for my Final Year Project. The app is written in Swift and SwiftUI using XCode. This app is currently still being worked on.

#### Abstract: 

The Careers Guidance App is designed to serve as a career guidance assistant for people in search of a third level undergraduate course in the Republic of Ireland. In order to help provide the user with the necessary information and support during their course search, the app includes a course matching questionnaire. Similar to a personality test, this questionnaire asks the user questions related to their interests and skills, both personal and academic. Once the user completes the questionnaire, course suggestions are generated that best match to their personality traits, skills and interests. The suggested courses are analysed based on the responses the user provided throughout the questionnaire.

#### Key Features / Functionality:

- Option to log in as an existing user, register as a new user or continue as a guest
- Course Matching Questionnaire
- Option to save questionnaire results to the Results Dashboard to view again at a later time
- In the Results Dashboard, users can view an analysis of their results (This feature is not available to guests)

This movies app includes 5 views on the site header menu bar which display different movie lists such as Home, Now Playing, Upcoming, Top Rated and Favourites. When you click on an individual movie card, it displays basic overview information on the selected movie, as well as cast details and recommended movies. There are two buttons on the bottom of the movie cards, one is a favourites button that when you click on it, it adds that selected movie to the favourites movie list view. The other button is labelled 'Similar Movies', where you can click on that to view the similar movies to the selected movie. You can also filter the movie lists by search, genres and ratings.

#### Key Features / Functionality:

+ When you click on a cast member it will bring you to a page where it shows their biography and a scrollable section with more pictures of the actor/actress.

+ Added a scrollable imageList to the movie posters on the left of the screen on the movies details page.

+ To make the app responsive, Responsive UI components were added such as ImageLists and Grids to the sections that didn't have these responsive features previously and to the sections that I newly added.

### GitHub Repo for assignment2-emmaroche: [Movies Web App 2](https://github.com/emmaroche/assignment2-emmaroche.git)

This is a further developed version of the Movies Web Application. This purpose of this further developed version of that app was to demonstrate knowledge of APIs, Express, Mongoose, and Authentication by developing an extension of a Movies API we used in practical classes.

#### Key Features / Functionality:

 + Added new views for login and sign up authentication.

 + Added style to login and sign up views to match the theme of the web app.

 + Added two new API routes, including a parameterised URL, for Latest movies that have been put out and Movie release dates for different countries.

 + Added React App integration where the React app makes a request to the Web API which would then request data from TMDB.

 + Mongo integration where I connected to the MongoDB database, created a db folder with an index.js file where I imported the db module into it and loaded the user data to MongoDB using seedDB.

 + Use of express middleware such as error handling in the web-api index.js and api/movies/index.js.
